# Technical Artist Roadmap

A comprehensive guide and resource collection for aspiring Technical Artists in the game industry. This roadmap covers various specializations, essential skills, and curated learning resources for each path.

## 🚀 Live Documentation

**[TA Roadmap](https://angelinahuang007.github.io/TA-Roadmap/)**

The documentation is built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), providing a modern, responsive documentation experience.

## 📚 What is Technical Art?

Technical Artists bridge the gap between artists and programmers, responsible for:

- Optimizing game performance and visual effects
- Developing tools and pipelines
- Creating shaders and effects
- Automating workflows
- Solving technical and artistic challenges
